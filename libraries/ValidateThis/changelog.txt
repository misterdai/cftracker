Version 0.5
-----------

- xml schema changed so that conditions are declared once in a <conditions> block at the top of the xml file, and then referred to by unique id throughout the rest of the document.
- omitting the context attribute on a <rule> OR specifying a context of "*" will add a rule to the default context, which will automatically add that rule to ALL contexts.
- when requesting validations from the BOValidator, specifying an empty context or a non-existent context will return the default context.

Version 0.6
-----------

- xml schema addition of an optional <contexts> block which allows a developer to define the name of a form that should be used when generating client side validations for a specific context.  This is optional as there are two other ways of specifying the form name to be used.
- added a ValidateThisConfig bean which is defined in the client coldspring.xml file and allows for customization of certain framework behaviours, including:
	- BOValidatorPath - which specifies where to find the BOValidator.cfc component.  This allows a developer to replace the BOValidator that comes with the framework with one of their own.
	- DefaultJSLib - which specifies the default JavaScript library to use when generating client-side validations.
	- JSRoot - which specifies the path to the JavaScript files which will be loaded by the framework.
	- defaultFormName - which specifies the form name to be used by default when generating client-side validations.
- added a getAllContexts() method to the BOValidator which will return a Struct containing all of the contexts defined for the object.  Each key in the struct will contain an array of all of the business rules defined for that context.
- added support for the remote attribute of the jQuery validation plugin.  Uses validation type "custom" with the parameter "remoteURL".
- added support for custom error messages for standard validations using the jQuery validation plugin.
- added automatic discovery of ClientScriptWriters, ClientRuleScripters and ServerRuleValidators so that they are no longer hardcoded into the coldspring config and new components will be recognized automatically.
- added a generateInitializationScript method which can be used to generate all of the JavaScript statements necessary to load and configure the required JS libraries.
- added a formName parameter to the getValidationScript method which allows a developer to pass in the name of a form when requesting client-side validation script.

Version 0.61
------------

- changed the validate() method in the BOValidator to return a Result object.  This should not affect backward compatibility and allows for a very simple integration scenario.

Version 0.62
------------

- added a getFailuresAsStruct() method to the Result object.
- changed the behaviour of the email ServerRuleValidator to not fail on blank values.


Version 0.65
------------

- implemented some internal changes required for Railo compatibility
- fixed a bug in the Custom ClientRuleScripter
- added the latest version of Brian Kotek's BeanInjector to the distribution

Version 0.7
------------

- removed reliance on Coldspring - all DI is now done within the framework
- added the ValidateThis.cfc service object, which allows for simpler integration
- changed the ServerRuleValidation_Numeric to not fail on an empty property
- added a getErrors method to the Result.cfc object to implement the interface for Model-Glue's ValidationErrorCollection

Version 0.75
------------

- added internationalization (i18n) support
- added a demo to show how to implement the i18n support

Version 0.80
------------

- changed the signature of the validate() method in the ValidateThis.cfc facade. The order of the first two arguments changed as objectType became an optional argument.
- created a Coldbox Plugin for ValidateThis!

Version 0.85
------------

- fixed a bug in ServerValidator.cfc that was causing conditions using non-numeric DependentPropertyValues to throw an error
- changed the getInitializationScript() method in the ValidateThis.cfc facade to not require an objectType
- changed the getInitializationScript() method to allow for selectively including or not including script to load the JS libraries
- xml files are now allowed to be named .xml.cfm 
- xml files can be contained in a folder under the defined definitionPath folder with the same name as the object type
- you can specify multiple folders in definitionPath in the ValidateThisConfig structure, and the framework will look in each of those folders, in the order specified, to find your xml files
- added a method for getFailuresAsString() to the Result.cfc object (thanks Craig McDonald)
- updated Coldbox Plugin in the following ways:
	- if no setting for VT_definitionPath is defined, it will use the setting for ModelsPath and the setting for ModelsExternalLocationPath, in that order, to look for the xml definition files
	- added a method called setupValidationSI() which uses the scriptInclude plugin to load JS into the page
	
The following may break backwards compatibility:
- changed arguments expected by getInitializationScript() from:
	<cfargument name="Context" type="any" required="false" default="" />
	<cfargument name="formName" type="any" required="false" default="#getFormName(arguments.Context)#" hint="The name of the form for which validations are being generated." />
	<cfargument name="JSLib" type="any" required="false" default="#variables.ValidateThisConfig.defaultJSLib#" />
	<cfargument name="locale" type="Any" required="no" default="" />

	to:
	<cfargument name="JSLib" type="any" required="false" default="#variables.ValidateThisConfig.defaultJSLib#" />
	<cfargument name="JSIncludes" type="Any" required="no" default="true" />
	<cfargument name="locale" type="Any" required="no" default="" />

Version 0.851
-------------

- a relative path specified in definitionPath may be specified with or without a trailing "/"

Version 0.9
-------------

- removed all the hacky code required to support a bug in cfinvoke in Railo, that has since been fixed

Version 0.91
-------------

- added support for Groovy objects and ColdFusion on Wheels object via the ObjectChecker object
- added a getVersion() method available from both the ValidateThis.cfc facade and the BOValidator which reports the current version of the framework

Version 0.92
-------------

- a couple of fixes for conditional validations and Groovy objects
- added the ability to specify external paths for ServerRuleValidators
- added a config option for abstractGetterMethod to allow for BOs with an abstract getter vs individual getters
- updated the ValidateThisCBPlugin with changes from John Whish

- added a (work-in-progress) demo for CF9 ORM and cf.Objective()
- fixed a css issue with the demo form
- fixed a bug with dependentPropertyValue with CF9 ORM objects

Version 0.94
-------------

- added the boolean validation type
- implemented proper optionality. All validations are now treated as optional unless the same property has been declared as required.
- the framework will now attempt to find a rules definition file in the same folder as the cfc if an object is passed into a method.
- added a newResult() method to the ColdBox plugin.
- added a getFailureMessages() method to the Result object which returns an array of all validation failure messages.
- fixed an issue with failure messages and the custom validation type wherein a failure message in the xml file would override a failure message generated by a custom method.

Version 0.95
-------------
- changed jQuery validations so that missing form fields will not generate a JavaScript error
- added the ResultPath config option to override the built-in Result object with a custom Result object
- fixed an issue with how delimiters were being added via the getFailuresAsString() method in the Result object
- added four new methods to the Result object: getFailuresByField(), getFailureMessagesByField(), getFailuresByProperty(), getFailureMessagesByProperty()
- the byField methods return a struct consisting of clientFieldNames, the byProperty methods return a struct consisting of propertyNames
- the getFailures methods return complete failure structs, the getFailureMessages methods return just the failure messages
- the getFailureMessages methods return an array of strings by default, but can return a string concatenated using a custom delimiter
- the above 4 new methods accept a limit argument which returns only the first x failures per field/property
- deprecated the getFailuresAsStruct method in the Result object in favour of getFailuresByField/getFailuresByProperty
- introduced externalFileReaders to enable both xml and json support
- made it easier to add new client script writers and client rule scripters which reside in a client application
- added LightWire for dependency injection
- incorporated a fix from Martijn van der Woud for the client-side equalTo validation
